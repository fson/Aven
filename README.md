## Framework

The framework consists of a few loosly-coupled components which are meant to work well together.

### Aven Views

A component toolkit for React Native and React Native Web. The UI building blocks of an Aven app.

### Aven Cloud

The database layer helps you manage several sources of data, handles real-time data syncronization, and supports user authentication and permissions (coming soon).

### Aven Navigation

Aven apps use React Navigation to share navigation logic and views between the web and react native. Aven Navigation is a set of navigators that are designed to be idiomatic on every platform, yet still customizable for most occasions.

### Aven Tools

A CLI and modular tooling environment to launch React Native apps on any platform, using a variety of bundlers and deployment mechanisms under the hood.
