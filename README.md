## Framework

The framework consists of a few loosly-coupled components which are meant to work well and support each-other.

### Aven Tools

A CLI and modular tooling environment to launch React Native apps on any platform, using a variety of bundlers and deployment mechanisms under the hood.

### Aven Data

The database layer handles realtime data syncronization, user permissions (coming soon), and helps you manage several sources of data.

### React Navigation

Aven apps use React Navigation to share navigation logic and views between the web and react native.
